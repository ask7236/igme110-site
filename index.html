             Hello, my name Andrew. I am an aspiring game designer/developer with a passion for games               
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Games have impacted my life ever since I was a young boy. They have helped me form and take part in communities and helped facilitate problem solving and teamwork between me and my peers.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I have some experience in Java, and C#. I have limited experience developing android applications and using Unity to make games. I also have limited experience in 3DS max.
