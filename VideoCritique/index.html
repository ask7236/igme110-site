            I took some wet clips and some dry clips, mixed them together and tried to extrapolate an abstract meaning from the chaos.

            When I started making this video, I didn't really know what I was making. I found some videos with water, then I found dry things, and then I tried to find meaning. I wanted to create something strange, abstract and funny with my project and Fishwater does not disappoint. I decided that the voiceover and the video would have a certain amount of dissonance because it created a more comical effect with a more serious sounding voice with some very ridiculous text on the screen.

                The critique helped me address an audio issue where the music and the voiceover were fighting for attention and also change some text to be more horribly misspelled for greater effect

            <li>Sil (Not in group): lower the music volume in the spaghetti section, so the voicover is clearer</li>
            <li>Result of a debate between all members of group: Make the last line of text spelled arrowdynamic instead of aerodynamic for greater comedic effect</li>
